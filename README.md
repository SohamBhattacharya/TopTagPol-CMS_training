# Training configuration file details
* Located under `configs`.
* Rule of thumb for the option `loadEventPerJob`: use 1/10th of the max jets per sample.

# Run/debug the training over a small dataset
1. Get interactive condor session: `condor_submit -i scripts/gpu_interactive.submit`. This can take some time.
2. Inititialize the conda environment and cd to the training directory.
3. `mkdir -p logs`.
4. `nohup python -u python/train.py --config configs/test_config.yml > logs/train.log &`.

The model will be saved in `training_results/model_checkpoints` with the date and time.
The tensorboard info will be saved in `training_results/tensorboard` with the date and time.

# Submit a training job over a large dataset
1. Inititialize the conda environment and cd to the training directory.
2. `python -u python/run_condor.py --tag <tag> --trainconfig <trainconfig> --condorconfig <condorconfig>`.
    * Use a meaningful name for `<tag>` (no spaces or special characters except `-` and `_`).
    * `<trainconfig>`: the training config file you want. This will be copied. The copied file can be edited before submission.
    * `<condorconfig>`: \
    For large dataset (about 100K or more per sample): `gpu_interactive_cudacapibility7_highmem.submit`. \
    For small dataset (about 10K or fewer per sample): `gpu_interactive.submit`.
3. This will create and list a few files. **Check them (especially the training config file) before submitting**.
4. If things look okay, submit using: `condor_submit <submit file>`. \
    Here `<submit file>` is the same as that printed by the previous command.
5. Check the status of the condor job(s) with: `condor_q <username>`.
6. If you want to abort your job(s):
    * `condor_rm <jobid>` will abort a particular condor job.
    * `condor_rm -u <username>` will abort all your condor jobs.
7. Once the job starts to run, it will create `job.out` in the condor directory. To monitor it, do `tail -f <file>`.
8. Warnings and errors will be in `job.err`.
9. Once the training starts, the model checkpoint and tensorboard directories will be created, and the latter can be viewed on a browser, even when the training is ongoing.

# View the tensorboard page
1. On another shell, login to NAF, cd to the training directory and run one of the following:
    * Particular training(s): \
    `tensorboard --logdir training_results/tensorboard/<dir1> training_results/tensorboard/<dir2> ...`. \
    Here `<dirN>` is any particular training under `training_results/tensorboard`.
    * The latest training (by date and time): \
    `tensorboard --logdir $(find training_results/tensorboard/ -maxdepth 1 | sort -V | tail -n 1)`.
2. On your machine run: `ssh -L 6006:127.0.0.1:6006 <username>@<host>.desy.de`. \
N.B. Use the same host as in step 1. For example, if you log into `naf-cms20.desy.de`, use the same as host here.
3. From the browser on your machine, open: `http://127.0.0.1:6006`
